If the position is already filled by a worker, then a qualified candidate
for the job cannot take it. A worker is fired only if they become a
"poor fit" in the eyes of their employer. 

By the time a worker is fired or retired for the position to become open again,
decades may have passed and the world has changed and moved on. 
The job is no longer available. 

Many jobs are merely decorative and require as much appearance as a 
C-grade model.

Life is not entirely about jobs.

Jobs consume people's lives.

Jobs pay workers money to do things because their efforts do not occur
in the natural state. 

Some jobs require more loyalty than the typical governmental job.

More than half of non-governmental jobs require the worker to work
at least as well as half of governmental jobs.

When qualified people talk about jobs, they are merely using statistics
because statistics is the only "hard" evidence there is for discussion.

The perceived prestige of a job is very cultural.

Jobs in theory put people in their place and keep the world very neat and ordered.
